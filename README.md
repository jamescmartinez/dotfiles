This repository includes my dotfiles.

As of January 2021, this repository no longer contains my macOS fresh install
setup script since it was tedious to maintain. Instead, I've created a Wiki with
instructions to manually set up a new installation of macOS [here](https://github.com/jamescmartinez/dotfiles/wiki/My-macOS).

Installation
------------
``` bash
git clone git://github.com/jamescmartinez/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
~/dotfiles/bin/setup
```
