This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles. This repository should be cloned to
your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles/`. The included installation
script creates symlinks from the dotfiles in your home directory to the dotfiles in the `~/dotfiles/` directory.

The installation script will backup your existing dotfiles into the
`~/dotfiles_old/` directory.

Installation
------------

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/jamescmartinez/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```
